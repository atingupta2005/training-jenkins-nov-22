# Performance Tips
## Addressing Slow Performance in Jenkins
-   Avoid Complex Groovy Script In Your Pipelines
    - Reduce the number as well as the complexity of Groovy scripts in your pipelines and instead favor plugins that can be run on each agent directly
-   Keep Builds Minimal at the Master Node
    - The number of builds on the master node significantly affects resource usage
-   Don’t Bloat the Jenkins Master Installation
    - DevOps professionals often work across multiple teams and projects for CI/CD-related tasks.
    - If that’s your situation, take care not to burden a single Jenkins master
    - Instead, create multiple masters
-   Make Agent Management Effortless
    - While setting up Jenkins, it’s important to set up the agents correctly
    - You want to make sure that when the time comes, you can add new agents or replace existing ones easily
    - To achieve this, consider creating a virtual machine image for the agent
    - You might also consider running Jenkins inside a Docker container in a scalable cluster like Kubernetes or Amazon EKS where scaling agents is simple
-   Remove Older Builds
    - After a while, Jenkins builds can pile up, and disk consumption may get out of hand.
    - Developers often overlook Jenkins’ Discard Old Builds option
    - Set metrics, such as the number of builds and days to keep builds
-   Avoid Plugin Overload
    - In order to determine if a plugin is causing your builds to slow down, you can try running your builds with all or some plugins disabled
    - Gradually add each back to determine which is causing the bottleneck.
